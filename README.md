# Java-CS-project
Java Swing Auditorium Scheduling System

# Re-Implementation of The published ""Auditorium Scheduling"" software ##

  This is a Java Swing Project that comes from a simple idea that turned into a mess of
sphagetti code due to the lack of time alloted to the project.

  feel free to add or refactor its structure, avoid as much as possible using AI to add
snippets of code to be implemented. 

  Only Use AI tools as references not as a way to go easy on things.

  the aim of the refactoring of the previous project is not only to improve its code
structure but to also improve the already strong development skills that one must 
have during the project's lifetime.
